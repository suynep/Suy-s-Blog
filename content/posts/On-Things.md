# On Religion, Spirituality, and Life: from the eyes of a blooming sun

If I told you I'm Religious, you'll laugh. If I, however, tell you that I'm Spiritual, you will hold me in a higher pedestal. The difference in terminology, though distinct, isn't totally disjoint in the aspect of conveyance. I'd say both religiosity, and spirituality are two faces of the same coin. The coin of metaphysics and it's abstractions. Shambhu Bholanath Yogi Mahadeva? What am I listening to? Raga Adana. Beautiful bhajana.
