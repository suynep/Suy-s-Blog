# For Bee

sky blushes in the faintest pink imaginable

with you lying there.

i interlock my fingers,

mustering the courage to speak.

"this is nostalgic"

"we shouldn't talk about it, suy"

"..."

*how do i tell you how much i miss you, and your presence*

miss with eyes that gaze like a serene pond

i love y-the reflections in your eyes.

the way you see

i'm never this soft, but you, miss,

who are you, who always take me homeward?


*i like you*

*i can't say the stronger word*

...
