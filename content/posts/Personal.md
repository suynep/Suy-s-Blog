# Hmmm..?

Anxiety is a strange demon. Laziness stands somewhere in the same pedestal for me. These two cling to my back like a two year old does his momma, and my sad soul has never ever been able to get rid of them in the slightest. Why though...? What would it take for me to change?

Determination? Not enough. Indulging myself in distractions that pertain to academia, but fruitless nevertheless? Pointless. I'm stuck. STOK.

This makes me feel inferior more than anything. Makes me compare me to others instead of myself. This is diabolic. This mind-state kills. Please Suy, work something out.
